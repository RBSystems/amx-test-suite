DESIGN CONCEPT
==============

Test suite executes the testSuiteRun() function, which should be
defined in the user's source code.  User's tests call functions from
the test suite.

User can interface with the test suite running on a NetLinx master
through the NetLinx Diagnostic application.

    FUTURE    
--------------

 * Event testing.

Use virtual device or intercept device events to be able to run device integration tests.  Preferably something that doesn't have to be switched between production and testing mode.

Include files contain virtual devices that are combined to physical devices in production, or combined to virtual device handlers in testing.  Testing can utilize a queue system to assert events.
