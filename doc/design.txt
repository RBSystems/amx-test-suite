DESIGN CONCEPT
==============

User telnet's into AMX box on port 5000.

User types the command "run" (no quotes) and the tests are run,
output being sent to port 5000 so the user can save the log.
* This could be turned into a TCP client app in the future. *

Test suite executes the 'testsRun' function, which should be
defined in the user's source code.  User's tests call functions from
the test suite.
